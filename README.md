# Project 2 â€“ Crowdfunding_ETL

Marshall Prose, Ashley Castaneda, Shaina Joseph

Background:
For this project, we worked in a group to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary method to extract and transform the data. 

/Crowdfunding_ETL/Starter_Files/ETL_Mini_Project_ACastaneda_MProse_SJoseph
This folder contains the final crowdfunding and contact analysis of the group in a single juypter notebook. This file includes the extraction and transformation of the crowdfunding and contact excel data to create different DataFrames. The DataFrames that were created were: Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contacts. 

/Crowdfunding_ETL/Database
This folder contains an ERD and a table schema. After the data was transformed and the four CSV files were created, they were used to create an ERD and a table schema to better visualize the data. The CSV file data was then uploaded into a Postgres database.

/Crowdfunding_ETL/Starter_Files/Resources
Directory containing files which were needed for the analysis and files that were created from the analysis. This includes excel files containing the data for the analysis and several CSV files that were created from exporting the DataFrames.
